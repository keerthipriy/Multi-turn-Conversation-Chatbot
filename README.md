# Smart Prompt-Driven Multi-Turn Conversational Chatbot

## UNIT–II: Prompt Engineering and Dialogue Management

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is developed as part of **UNIT–II: Prompt Engineering and Dialogue Management** in the course **Designing Conversational AI**.

The objective of this project is to help students **understand and practically apply prompt engineering and dialogue management concepts** using a topic-wise, modular Python implementation, similar to the structure followed in UNIT–I.

The project uses a **menu-driven approach** to demonstrate each concept independently.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Understand how prompts influence AI behavior
- Implement zero-shot, few-shot, and role-based prompting
- Design structured prompts
- Manage multi-turn conversations
- Control AI behavior using temperature, max tokens, and stop sequences
- Handle dialogue interruptions and errors
- Debug and refine prompts
- Gain hands-on experience with GenAI APIs
